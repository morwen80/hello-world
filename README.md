# hello-world

Hello accidental reader!

I'm one of the many Italians living in London. Currenly working in an office and coding as much as possible while I can. Recently started the #100DaysOfCode and can't believe how much I have learnt, and how much I feel like I don't know!
GitHub seems pretty important in the development community so here I am.
